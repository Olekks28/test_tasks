# Website analytics problem


## Input Files
Two files named **`day1.csv`** and **`day2.csv`** must be located in the project folder together with **`main.py`**.  
Each file must start with a header line: 
```csv
user_id,product_id,timestamp
```
followed by the data rows.
If necessary, the names of the input files can be changed directly in the code (marked with a comment).


## Example of csv-file
```csv
user_id,product_id,timestamp
1,101,2025-09-30 12:01:00
20,11,2025-09-30 12:41:00
```
