# Laptop Selection Problem

## Two solutions for selecting laptops to maximize capital are presented:  

1. **Greedy algorithm** – `greedy.py`  
   **Time complexity:** O(N * K)  

2. **Heap-based algorithm (using Python's built-in `heapq` module)** – `heap.py`  
   **Time complexity:** O(K log K)

## Input format

- Start capital `C`  
- Maximum number of laptops `N`  
- Total number of laptops `K`  
- Prices array  
- Gains array  

**Note:** Prices and gains arrays should be entered as a single line of space-separated numbers.
